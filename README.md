Electronic Medical Records on Block Chain.
MedX, a proof-of-concept that would allow patients to record medical information on the ethereum blockchain.We are giving the patients control over their own medical records and the decision to make certain aspects public or private, while still being stored in a distributed global manner.The product will be useful in medical emergencies as the medical records of a user can be accessed whenever and wherever required and will quicken the process of treatment and will help in saving storage space.

Whenever a new user joins the block chain or a user shares his/her medical record with a doctor for consulation,he/she pays a certain fee(ether) to the miners approving the transcation.
